      <description>I am currently reading for my Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Prior to that I completed my undergraduate degree in Accounting &amp;amp; Finance at Athens University of Economics and Business.
I am passionate about the markets and find very exciting the analysis and integration of world economic and geopolitical events in potential trading ideas and algorithms.
In my free time I like to take salsa dancing lessons and go to salsa parties.</description>

      <description>This report contains a detailed analysis of the AirBnb market across Hong Kong. We begin by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis and visualize some key findings from our dataset. Next, we visualize the distribution of AirBnB rentals across the city using Mapping. Subsequently, we try to come up with a Regression Model that predicts the average cost for a four night stay for 2 people in Hong Kong.</description>
