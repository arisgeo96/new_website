      <description>I am currently reading for my Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Prior to that I completed my undergraduate degree in Accounting &amp;amp; Finance at Athens University of Economics and Business.
I am passionate about the markets and find very exciting the analysis and integration of world economic and geopolitical events in potential trading ideas and algorithms.
In my free time I like to take salsa dancing lessons and go to salsa parties.</description>
