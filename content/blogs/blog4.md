title: About Me
---
I am currently reading for my Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Prior to that I completed my undergraduate degree in Accounting & Finance at Athens University of Economics and Business.

I am passionate about the markets and find very exiting the analysis and integration of world economic and geopolitical events in potential trading ideas and algorithms.

In my free time I like to take salsa dancing lessons and go to salsa parties. The picture above was taken at one of them! I have also appeared in a professional team. Â¡Aguaaaa!
